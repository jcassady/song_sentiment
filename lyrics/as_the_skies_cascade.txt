Our world is broken
Our star is falling
The portal's open
The end is calling
Our time has come

The light is fading
Beyond the horizon
The last setting of the sun

The stars won't shine forevermore
When to our end we soar
The moon will lose her way
As the skies cascade

Our final journey
As time unravels
Through space unfurling
Toward the shadow
Our time has come

The light is fading
And now we are nearing
The last setting of the sun

The stars won't shine forevermore
When to our end we soar
The moon will lose her way
As the skies cascade

As the skies cascade
